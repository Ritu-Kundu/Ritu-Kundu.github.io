		<p>This post is meant to act as an index of the posts and resources which formed the basis of my “biological” understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">DISCLAIMER: My posts here are more or less only a compilation summarising what I learned from various resources (also listed in this post and also cited in specific posts). More often than not, these are in the same words as those I read or heard. I am not trying to reinvent the wheel or to dress it up differently to claim it my own.</p>
<h1>My Posts</h1>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/old-blogs/import-bio-basics/import-bio-basics-groundrules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bio.Basics.GroundRules</a> : This post is meant to lay some ground rules by describing some preliminary concepts that most of us might have learned in high school.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/old-blogs/import-bio-basics/import-bio-basics-genome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bio.Basics.Genome</a> : In this post, I have just re-published a part of my PhD thesis that kind of summarises the “genome” part that was sufficient for me, a CS type of person, to get started with the algorithms in bioinformatics.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Resources</h1>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">To know the required biology for being a rookie bioinfomatician using purely the computer science framework and terminology (without the depth and “burden” of real biochemical processes), <strong>Chapter 1</strong> of the book “<strong><a href="http://www.genome-scale.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genome-Scale Algorithm Design</a></strong>” is an excellent starting point. The whole book itself is of great value when it comes to understanding the algorithmic foundations behind the widely-used tools in bioinformatics.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">To brush up the biology concept that one may have learned in high school, this <strong><a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-biology1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">course</a></strong> proves out to be a good resource. Specifically, <strong>modules 3 (Important Biological Macromolecules), 4 (Cellular Structure), and 8 to 11 (Cell Division; DNA Structure and Replication; DNA Transcription and Translation; Gene Expression)</strong> are worth having a cursory look.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">To really learn Biology 101, I found this course–<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-biology-the-secret-of-life-4"><strong>Introduction to Biology: The Secret of Life</strong></a>–on edX by Prof. Eric Lander to be extremely helpful. Especially, lectures from Week 5 to Week 9 (DNA and replication; Transcription, Translation, and Variations; Recombinant DNA, Genomics).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">To quickly glance through terminology and glossary of the terms used in bioinformatics, <a href="http://www.ufrgs.br/lbma/animacoes/bioinf/_glossary300.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a> serves the purpose.</li>
</ul>
